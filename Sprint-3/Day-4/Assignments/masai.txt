Hello, My name is Rutuja Umap 
This is my Sprint-3 in Masai school & 
I am enjoying the journey till date. 
Yes I face a lot of challanges to complete my assignment,
to manage a time whole now. Intially it feels like it is impossible for me 
to manage this schedule with a lot of tasks and assignments but now I am able to manage 
time for everything I am learning how to manage all this things at a time with a pressure
on our head of that we have to do it.
I am learning new things in masai not about only technical but also about personality developement,
speaking skills and many more.
In short, I am enjoying this journey.
